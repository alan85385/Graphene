# Graphene
## Main Idea
### 1. Prepare the unit cell and the basis vector
### 2. Generate the periodic stucture which is the first layer of the lattice system
### 3. Copy and rotate the first layer which is the second layer of the lattice system
### 4. Find the overlap points as the twisted bilayer system's unit cell (also called moir√© pattern)
